          <h3>Self Reflection</h3>
          <p>This video is a self portrait. My goal was not to tell my life story, but to show a small part of my identity -an appreciation for calmness and nature. The reason being that it is more important to focus on the here and now. Rather than dwelling on the past, I hope in stressful times to just relax and reflect.</p>

          <h3>Diversion</h3>
          <p>Inspiration for the video was Maya Deren who had a way about combining video clips together that do not appear to combine but end up creating an interesting outcome. This video was for a surrealism assignment. My goal was to have fun with games by switching between each other.</p>

          <h3>Self Reflection</h3>
          <p>This video is a self portrait. My goal is to show a part of myself which is an appreciation for calmness and nature. It was not to tell my complete story. I believe in the present moment; the past is in the past. Whenever there is something stressful in life, I hope to just relax and reflect.</p>

          <h3>Diversion</h3>
          <p>Inspiration for the video was Maya Deren who had a way about combining video clips together that do not appear to combine but end up creating an interesting outcome. This video was for a surrealism assignment. My goal was to have fun with games by switching between each other.</p>
